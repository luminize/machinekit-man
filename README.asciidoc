Machinekit MANPAGE documentation
================================

This repository is automatically generated from manpages that are generated
during a build. Pull requests against this repository are therefore useless.

If you notice erroneous information, please try to correct the manpages in the
right place.

. files which have `1`, `3`, `3hal`, `3hm2.`, `3rtapi.` or `9` in the extension
  are manually made at some point in history, and should be corrected in
  `man/man1`, `man/man3` or `man/man9`
. files with `9comp` in the extension are generated during building the components and
  have their origin in `src/hal/components`, `src/hal/drivers` or
  `src/machinetalk/msgcomponents` and should be corrected in the source.
